# Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] and completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path. Routing and components were already implemented.
My task was to create the Redux part for three slices (Cards, Quizzes and Topics), managing component states, actions, reducers and extra reducers, using Redux ToolKit.

## How to Use

Open <https://bruno-flashcards-project.netlify.app/>. It's a simple application to create Topics and Quizzes. It can help you study, act as a planner or even create quizzes to challenge your friends!
The usability is very simple. There are three menu itens:

* Topics: here you have all the topics you've created, with their respective name, icon and quizzes. You can click in a topic to view all the quizzes associated.
* Quizzes: here you can view all quizzes created, regardless of their topic.
* New Quiz: here you can create a new quiz, selecting which topic it'll be associated and a front/back card message. To switch between front and back, just click on the card.

# Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
