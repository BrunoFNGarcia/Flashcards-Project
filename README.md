# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] and completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path. Routing and components were already implemented.
My task was to create the Redux part for three slices (Cards, Quizzes and Topics), using Redux ToolKit.

## How to Use

Open <https://bruno-flashcards-project.netlify.app/>. It's a simple application to create Topics and Quizzes for each Topic. It can help you study, act as a planner or even create quizzes to challenge your friends!
The usability is very simple. There are three menu itens:

*Topics: here you have all the topics you've created, with their respective name, icon and quizzes. You can click in a topic to view all the quizzes associated.
*Quizzes: here you can view all quizzes created, regardless of their topic.
*New Quiz: here you can create a new quiz, selecting which topic it'll be associated and a front/back card message. To switch between front and back, just click on the card.

# Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
